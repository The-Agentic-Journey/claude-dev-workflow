# Ubiquitous Language Glossary

This glossary defines the shared vocabulary used throughout the system. All team members and documentation should use these terms consistently.

## Methodology Terms

### Monorepo
All project code lives in a single repository. Every package, service, library, and configuration file is versioned together. There are no multi-repo splits — one repo, one `./do` script, one source of truth.

Key properties:
- **Single repository:** All code, documentation, and infrastructure in one place
- **Unified tooling:** The `./do` script is the single entry point for all tasks across all packages
- **Atomic changes:** Cross-package changes are a single commit, not coordinated across repos

### `./do` Script
The project's single entry point for all development tasks. Self-contained, auto-installing, and the only thing a developer needs to know after `git clone`.

Key properties:
- **One-stop shop:** `./do run` starts everything, `./do check` verifies everything
- **Self-contained:** Auto-installs dependencies, checks prerequisites, handles setup
- **Minimal host requirements:** Only requires bash and the project's primary runtime
- **Running documentation:** The script IS the setup guide — reading it tells you how the project works
- **Monorepo-aware:** Orchestrates across all packages in the repo

### Package
A distinct unit within the monorepo — a service, library, frontend app, or other self-contained module. Packages live in top-level directories and are orchestrated by the `./do` script.

## How to Add New Terms

When introducing a new domain concept:

1. **Choose the right category** — Group related terms together. Create a new category if none fits.
2. **Write a precise definition** — Avoid ambiguity. If a term means something specific in this project that differs from common usage, call that out explicitly.
3. **List key properties** — What are the important attributes or characteristics?
4. **Note relationships** — Reference other glossary terms where relevant.
5. **Keep it current** — Update definitions when the domain model evolves. Remove terms that are no longer used.

### Format
