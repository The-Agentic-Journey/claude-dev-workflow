## How to Add New Terms

When introducing a new domain concept:

1. **Choose the right category** — Group related terms together. Create a new category if none fits.
2. **Write a precise definition** — Avoid ambiguity. If a term means something specific in this project that differs from common usage, call that out explicitly.
3. **List key properties** — What are the important attributes or characteristics?
4. **Note relationships** — Reference other glossary terms where relevant.
5. **Keep it current** — Update definitions when the domain model evolves. Remove terms that are no longer used.
