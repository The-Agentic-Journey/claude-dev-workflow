## Before Starting Work

### 1. Understand the Domain

Read in this order:
1. `product/DDD/glossary.md` - Learn the vocabulary
2. `product/DDD/context-map.md` - Understand bounded contexts
3. Relevant context file in `product/DDD/contexts/` for the area you'll modify

### 2. Check Existing Decisions

Review `product/ADR/` for architecture decisions. Don't contradict established patterns without good reason and a new ADR.

### 3. Check for Pending Plans

Look in `product/plans/todo/` for any plans awaiting implementation.

## Source Code Structure

```

```

## Development Commands

```bash
./do build     # Build the project
./do lint      # Run linter
./do test      # Run tests
./do run       # Run the project locally
./do check     # Full verification (must pass before every commit)
```

## Planning and Implementation

### Creating Plans

Use `/plan` to create feature plans. Plans live in `product/plans/todo/` and include:
- Phased implementation steps
- DDD documentation updates (glossary, contexts, context map)
- Architecture decision records for significant decisions
- Verification steps for each phase

### Implementing Plans

Use `/implement` to execute plans. The implementation process:
1. Reads the plan and breaks it into phases
2. Delegates each phase to a sub-agent
3. Runs `./do check` after each phase
4. Creates a focused commit per phase
5. Moves completed plans to `product/plans/done/`

### Verification Rule

**`./do check` must pass before every commit.** No exceptions. No partial substitutes (`./do lint` alone, `./do build` alone, etc.).

## Pre-change Questions

Before making significant changes, ask:
1. Does this align with existing ADRs?
2. Which bounded context does this belong to?
3. Should this be a new plan document first?
4. Have I read the existing code I'm modifying?
5. Does this maintain the simplicity principle?
